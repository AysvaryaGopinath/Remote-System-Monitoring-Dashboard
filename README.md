# Remote-System-Monitoring-Dashboard
The project aims to provide system analysis of the Raspberry Pi 4. It captures various system metrics, including CPU usage, Disk IO, network activity, CPU/GPU temperature, memory usage, running processes, system uptime, and system events/logs. An external  GPIO push button press triggers the system analysis, and the metrics are collected. The Raspberry Pi acts as a TCP server transmitting the collected metrics over Wifi using sockets to a remote client(e.g, a mobile app).
